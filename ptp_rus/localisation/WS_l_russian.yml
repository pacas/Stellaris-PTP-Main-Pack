  pc_dn_star_desc:0 "Space is vast. Much of it is empty. All of it is dangerous. This "wild space" is not so much a system as a confluence point; a gravitational anomaly from which it would be advisable to move on quickly. It can never be colonised."
  pc_WS_barycenter:0 "Barycenter"
  pc_WS_barycenter_desc:1 "This is not an actual object; rather, it is an imaginary point that two binary objects orbit."

####TECHNOLOGIES#########
 tech_WS_gateways: "Advanced Gateway Construction"
 tech_WS_gateways_desc: "Extensive experimentation and analysis of the gravitational peculiarities of unstable hyperlanes in Wild Space has enhanced our understanding of the Gateway network. We can now build modified Gateways in unclaimed Wild Space."

 tech_WS_sensors_wormhole: "Wormhole Sensor Modulation"
 tech_WS_sensors_wormhole_desc: "Wormholes' radiation has previously rendered our most advanced sensors useless. But extensive analysis of the interior of these space time anomalies has led to subtle advancements which compensate for that distortion. We can now tune our sensors to see through Wormholes."
 tech_WS_sensors_wormhole_small: "Allows sensors to penetrate wormhole systems."

 tech_WS_sensors_nebula_1: "Nebula Sensor Modulation"
 tech_WS_sensors_nebula_1_desc: "Subtle changes in our sensor technology allow us to compensate for the gravitational peculiarities caused by nebulae and the unstable hyperlanes in Wild Space."
 tech_WS_sensors_nebula_1_small: "Allows sensors to see into nebulae, deep into Wild Space and through space storms."

 #tech_WS_sensors_nebula_1: "Nebula Sensor Modulation"
 #tech_WS_sensors_nebula_1_desc: "Subtle changes in our sensor technology allow us to compensate for the gravitational peculiarities caused by nebulae and the unstable hyperlanes in Wild Space."
 #tech_WS_sensors_nebula_1_small: "Allows sensors to see into nebulae and into the fringes of Wild Space."

 #tech_WS_sensors_nebula_2: "Advanced Nebula Sensor Modulation"
 #tech_WS_sensors_nebula_2_desc: "Significant advances in our sensor technology have overcome the difficulties presented by all but the very most extreme natural phenomena to be found in this Galaxy. This will enable our hyperspace sensors to pierce the veil deep into Wild Space and through any inclement space weather."
 #tech_WS_sensors_nebula_2_small: "Allows sensors to see deep into Wild Space and through space storms."
