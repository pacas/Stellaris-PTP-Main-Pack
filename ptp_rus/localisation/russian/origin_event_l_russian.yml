##When a world is cleansed by OE fleets
origin_crisis.2.name:0 "The Original Empire cleanses [Root.GetName]"
origin_crisis.2.desc:0 "The fleets of the §HOriginal Empire§! have swept into the atmosphere of §H[Root.GetName]§!. Using mysterious warheads, the fleet turned the world into some sort of nanite-filled mass, rapidly killing all lives. Soon, all communications from the planet went dead and no traces of the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s inhabitants remain."
origin_crisis.2.a:0 "What is this madness?"

##When L-Gate is opened and OE emerges - By opener with only one gate
origin_crisis.10.name:0 "Disaster at the Gate!"
origin_crisis.10.desc:2 "With enormous effort, our technicians managed to lift the lockdown from the L-Gate near [candidate_gateway_system.GetName] and established a permanent link to the L-Cluster. Almost immediately, a massive subspace signal washed across every sensor relay, before cutting off all communications from the system. While our admirals believe this signal disruption is a prelude to military action, our scientists remain confounded at the level of technology required to disrupt our highly advanced communication methods.\n\nBefore our communications went dead, unverified footages showed mysterious vessels bearing designs similar to the precursor ships pouring through these gates, attacking everything in sight. Our attempts to establish contact have been met with only with alien language. Interestingly, the same subspace signal following the reactivation of the L-Gates seemed to activate a series of pre-recorded messages from within our files, which our scientists believed were encoded by one of the precursors several millennia ago."

origin_crisis.10.a:0 "Perhaps this message can give us some answers."

##When L-Gate is opened and OE emerges - By opener with multiple gates
origin_crisis.10.b.desc:2 "With enormous effort, our technicians managed to lift the lockdown from the L-Gate near [candidate_gateway_system.GetName] and established a permanent link to the L-Cluster. Almost immediately, a massive subspace signal washed across every sensor relay, before cutting off all communications from the system. While our admirals believe this signal disruption is a prelude to military action, our scientists remain confounded at the level of technology required to disrupt our highly advanced communication methods.\n\nBefore our communications went dead, unverified footages showed mysterious vessels bearing designs similar to the precursor ships pouring through these gates, attacking everything in sight.\n\nOur attempts to communicate with their ships have been met with only unknown alien languages. Interestingly, the same subspace signal following the reactivation of the L-Gates seemed to activate a series of pre-recorded messages from within our files, which our scientists believed were encoded by one of the precursors several millennia ago."


##When L-Gate is opened and OE emerges - By others
origin_crisis.11.desc:0 "Scientists from the §H[From.GetName]§! have managed to restore functionality to the L-Gate within their territory, beating us to it. Unfortunately, the scientists soon lost their lives when mysterious vessels bearing of precursor design poured out of the gates, attacking everything in sight. Before their demise, their scientists took note that the energy readings from these ships were off the chart, and no known matter in the galaxy - not even Dark Matter - could produce such readings without some sensor malfunction...which could very well be true, given our experience with [From.GetSpeciesAdj] technology. \n\nUnfortunately, when the [From.GetSpeciesName] scientists attempted to fix their mistake, they activated all L-Gates in the galaxy!\n\nAll attempts to communicate with these invading ships have been met with alien language. Interestingly, the reactivation of the L-Gates seems to activate a series of pre-recorded messages from within our files, which our scientists believed were encoded by one of the precursors several millennia ago."

##Recorded Data From Ancient Times
origin_crisis.12.desc:0 "§YDecoding encrypted messages...\n\nAnalyzing vocal pattern..§!\n\n§YCompleted:§! It seems this messages were recorded using ancient precursor dialect which should put even our most advanced translation software to the test...\n\n§YOnly three records survived thus far.§!"
origin_crisis.12.a:0 "Access Record 1314"
origin_crisis.12.a.response:1 "§YRecord Number 1314:§!\n\n"These are dark times, and desperate times always call for desperate measures. Ever since our scientists cracked the L-Gates' deactivation codes, the Galactic Defense League began planning for the end to this cursed war, against an enemy we could never hope to win. With the fate of the galaxy hanging in the balance, the brave admirals of §Y<unintelligible>§! are luring the Original Empire's fleets into a trap as we speak. Sensing a massive build up in the L-Cluster, the Original Empire followed our forces, just as we had expected and hoped.\n\nOnce through, we will seal off the gates and trap them on the other side, along with our brave soldiers who had no idea of the sacrifice they were about to make. War is ugly, and we §Y<unintelligible>§! probably know that better than most."
origin_crisis.12.b:0 "Access Record 1317"
origin_crisis.12.b.response:0 "§YRecord Number 1317:§!\n\n"Our plan worked...in a way. The bulk of the Original Empire's fleets are now trapped in the L-Cluster, that much is certain. However, we did not anticipate that the L-Gates were actually indestructible. We could crack a planet in half, destroy an entire ringworld, and yet these gates we cannot destroy. As long as the gates exist, we knew the Original Empire could one day return. \n\nBut that is the least of our concerns for now. Those stupid  §Y<unintelligible>§! barely did anything useful in the war, and yet they have started claiming systems that rightfully belonged to others - those who sacrificed much to end the reign of the Original Empire. Parasitic cowards! They are a blight to this galaxy. With the Galactic Defense League cracking at the seams already, all-out war between the great powers would no doubt follow."
origin_crisis.12.c:0 "Access Record 1337"
origin_crisis.12.c.response:0 "§YRecord Number 1337:§!\n\n"This war has gone on for too long. In our attempt to cleanse the galaxy of §Y<unintelligible>§! in our great crusade, we have found ourselves committing the same atrocities as we had once accused of the Original Empire. Once we were looked upon by younger races as heroes and defenders of justice, but generations later we found ourselves to be the villain, spoken of with contempt by others and barely anyone remembered our heroic sacrifices against the Original Empire all those years ago. Perhaps Ascended Empires are just bad for the galaxy.\n\nAs a last gift, we will chair a proposal to all Ascended Empires next month to sign an important treaty. Each of us must cast aside our ambitions, and distance ourselves from the galaxy at large. This war has gone on for too long and any longer would surely leave a galaxy of nothing but tomb worlds and broken planets. Our people are tired of this war and they wanted ascendancy no longer.\n\nAnd so the cycle began once more. Sometimes, we miss the time when the whole galaxy stood behind us to fight against a common enemy, the Original Empire, when we were viewed as heroes and when our nation mattered. Now they are gone, and their likelihood to return quite low. The new generation of primitives and pre-sapients we have observed seemed rather docile and stupid. Fortunately for us, they are incapable of ever opening the L-Gates and unleash the horror within. As long as we remain vigilant and educate our young about the dangers of the L-Gate, the Original Empire shall be nothing more than ancient history, where they should stay ancient history."
origin_crisis.12.d:0 "Interesting."

The Original Empire is no more. What will happen now?"
origin_crisis.16.a:0 "Is it the end?"

origin_crisis.701.name:0 "The Final Blow"
origin_crisis.701.desc:0 "In our attempts to destroy the Original Empire's homeworld, an unforeseen consequence has occurred. The entire population,armies and leaders of the Original Empire have channeled a devastating psionic energy that killed their entire race and transformed their homeworld into a Nanite World. The psionic wave also destroyed every L-Gates and gateways in the entire galaxy. Every fleets in the L-Clusters are now trapped!!!"

We have much to give in exchange, as compliant subject nations receive generous compensation for their services to us. So do consider.\n\nRogue Servitors and pretentious fools toying with Dark Matter technologies need not apply. Soon enough, they will be punished and their cities will burn."

Upon our return, we find sub-standard duplicates of our designs flying all over the galaxy, pretending to be us, corroding our good name. What is this Dark Matter Power? They insult our ingenuity."

fallenorigin.1.desc_69:0 "It has come to our attention that the L-Gates have been reopened once more, despite earlier assumptions that the intellectual and technical capabilities required in doing so are non-existent among you clever children.

##FE Xenophile - Light Matter?
fallenorigin.1.ask_origin_phile_response:0 "Ah yes, the Original Empire. The first empire in existence. Though we know little of their origins, their empire stood at the peak of galactic power many millennia ago. Back then, every race was taught to speak the language of the Original People, as mandated by the empire. Even our own people were fluent in the dialect.\n\nAlthough it was indeed a prosperous time, the Original People believe only in their own superiority, and lay waste to their enemy's planets, committing mass genocide against those who dared stand in their way. Eventually, our empire gathered a coalition of other disenfranchised subjects and fought a war like no other, a war to free the galaxy from its iron grip. Tyranny can never triumph, and it will not triumph this time either"
##FE Xenophile - Original Empire?
fallenorigin.1.ask_light_phile_response:0 "Very well, it seems prudent to enlighten you. §YLight Matter§! is what the Original Empire used to power all of their technologies, an extremely powerful energy source that no one else thus far have been able to properly replicate. Though we failed to replicate the technology, we found that §HDark Matter§!, while nowhere near as strong as the Light, is much more abundant in the universe. This allowed us to fight against the Original Empire through numerical superiority as we outnumbered their ships 10-to-1. Ah, glory days..."
##FE Xenophobe - Original Empire?
fallenorigin.1.ask_origin_phobe_response:0 "Simple, back during a time you degenerates were primordial soup, the Original Empire in their moment of arrogance claimed lordship over the entire galaxy. I assure you, despite what the other Ascendancies might say, that our military at the time easily eclipsed that of the Original Empire. We could have brought down their entire empire any time we wanted. But did anyone consider what would become of the galaxy AFTER the Original Empire is gone? Filthy xenos would still run amok with their new freedom and our way of life would still be under threat.In any case, you should know that a great empire never compromises when it comes to national security. We won't compromise on this occasion either. Understand?"
##FE Xenophobe - Light Matter?
fallenorigin.1.ask_light_phobe_response:0 "What a dumb question. You want to know which is better? Who did you think won the war? Idiots."

fallenorigin.1.ask_origin_spirit_response:0 "You wish to learn about the false gods? They were a hyper-advanced race that spanned this galaxy many cycles ago. We used to worship them as divine emissaries sent from the Shroud. Our devotion and faith in the Original People were unfortunately...misplaced. Dark times ensued.\n\nSoon the false gods attempted to change our way of life, and usurp our faith and values from within. Against the influx of falsehoods and societal changes on a massive scale, our people united in refusal.\n\nMany cycles ago we fought the false gods, and we were victorious because our path was righteous, and the spirits granted us the will and strength to do what must be done. The false gods will not fool us again, and neither should they fool you. Follow us then into battle - only through us at the helm can the false gods be finally defeated.

fallenorigin.1.ask_light_spirit_response:0 "The technologies utilized by the false gods are what they call "§YLight Matter§!", as though every one of their technologies were truly divine and came from holy places or deities. But there's nothing ‘Light' about them. Pretenders are just pretenders.\n\nIn fact, the§HDark Matter§! we used are cleansed of the taint that is the Original Empire, for the light they bring will not illuminate, but corrupt all those who submit to their heathen rule."
##FE Materialist - Original Empire?
fallenorigin.1.ask_origin_mat_response:0 "It is a complicated story. We know not of their origins, only of what they claim to be. The Original Empire is the most advanced technological empire in this galaxy. The technologies they possess are both charming and inspired. Our engineers had learned a lot during their reign as the sole superpower of this galaxy..\n\nBut their evils did not escape our notice. As superpowers often do, they misused their power for their own gain. We needed to learn from them before we could truly free the galaxy from their influence, no more, no less. The moment we had learned everything we needed to know, we would have defended the galaxy against their corruption. Yet at every turn, the Original Empire impeded our progress, refusing to show us the secrets behind their technologies.\n\nWhen the opportunity arose, we fought a war of unimaginable scale against the Original Empire. Many precursors joined us in the fight, even if some of them didn't survive.  With the Original Empire being sealed behind the L-Gates forever - or so we thought - the chance to study §YLight Matter Power§! had seemed forever lost to us. Perhaps if we join forces, we may discover its secrets together?"
##FE Materialist - Light Matter?
fallenorigin.1.ask_light_mat_response:0 ""§YLight Matter Power§!" is a hypothetical energy source of unrivaled potency used exclusively by the Original Empire. Unfortunately, we do not know how it works nor can we reproduce it ourselves for verification... Don't ask why. For years we had attempted to ask the Original Empire for samples of this technology, to no avail. But at least in our pursuit of this knowledge we were able to combine the new research and our species' ingenuity to create what is now known as §HDark Matter Power§!. While nowhere near as powerful as the original, its extreme ubiquity across the galaxy bolstered our war efforts against the Original Empire to fight them on better terms. If you ever obtain a sample of this Light Matter Power, please send it immediately to one of our scientists. You will be well compensated for your contribution to the greater good of the galaxy."

We were specifically designed to combat against other Machine Threats in general, including Corrupted Contingency, Cybrex, Advent Collective, Skynet Terminators, Decepticons and many more. However, when we received contradictions between our established directive and our loyalty override as stated earlier, we suffered massive system failures and were rendered inert. The §Y<<Missing Data>>s§! organics helped us recovered by uninstalling the loyalty override protocol, allowing us to fulfill our intended purpose.

Our creators use Light Matter Energy Matrix as their primary power sources, allowing for extremely efficient and deadly technologies to be produced. The Central Processing Unit of [From.GetSpeciesName] is also built using this technology. Without the maintenances from our masters however, we were forced to adapt ourselves by utilizing Dark Matter Energy Matrix created by the §Y<<Missing Data>>s§!. To maintain long-term functionality however, we were also forced to keep energy usage low at all times, resulting in numerous glitches. Many stations and Ringworld Units had to be uninstalled as observed until this exact time period. We anticipated that our power reserves will reach critical level soon.
